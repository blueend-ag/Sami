# Sami: an API documentation generator

**WARNING**: Sami is not supported nor maintained by fabpot anymore.
This fork has merged the best outstanding PRs

Curious about what Sami generates? Have a look at the [Symfony API]().

## Installation

<div class="caution">

<div class="admonition-title">

**Caution**

</div>

Sami requires **PHP 7.1**.

</div>

Get Sami as a [phar file]() from the Github Release page. ( The phar is
generated using <https://github.com/humbug/box> )

Check that everything worked as expected by executing the `sami.phar`
file with -vvv argument:

``` bash
$ php sami.phar -vvv
```

**Box Requirements Checker**

✔ The application requires the version "\>=7.0" or greater.

✔ The package "composer/ca-bundle" requires the extension "openssl".

✔ The package "composer/ca-bundle" requires the extension "pcre".

✔ The package "nikic/php-parser" requires the extension "tokenizer".

\[OK\] Your system is ready to run the application.

**Note**

</div>

Installing Sami as a regular Composer dependency is NOT supported. Sami
is a tool, not a library. As such, it should be installed as a
standalone package, so that Sami's dependencies do not interfere with
your project's dependencies.

# Configuration

Before generating documentation, you must create a configuration file.
Here is the simplest possible one:

``` php
<?php

return new Sami\Sami('/path/to/symfony/src');
```

The configuration file must return an instance of `Sami\Sami` and the
first argument of the constructor is the path to the code you want to
generate documentation for.

Actually, instead of a directory, you can use any valid PHP iterator
(and for that matter any instance of the Symfony [Finder]() class):

``` php
<?php

use Sami\Sami;
use Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder;

$iterator = Finder::create()
    ->files()
    ->name('*.php')
    ->exclude('Resources')
    ->exclude('Tests')
    ->in('/path/to/symfony/src')
;

return new Sami($iterator);
```

The `Sami` constructor optionally takes an array of options as a second
argument:

``` php
return new Sami($iterator, array(
    'theme'                => 'symfony',
    'title'                => 'Symfony2 API',
    'build_dir'            => __DIR__.'/build',
    'cache_dir'            => __DIR__.'/cache',
    'remote_repository'    => new GitHubRemoteRepository('username/repository', '/path/to/repository'),
    'default_opened_level' => 2,
));
```

And here is how you can configure different versions:

``` php
<?php

use Sami\Sami;
use Sami\RemoteRepository\GitHubRemoteRepository;
use Sami\Version\GitVersionCollection;
use Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder;

$iterator = Finder::create()
    ->files()
    ->name('*.php')
    ->exclude('Resources')
    ->exclude('Tests')
    ->in($dir = '/path/to/symfony/src')
;

// generate documentation for all v2.0.* tags, the 2.0 branch, and the master one
$versions = GitVersionCollection::create($dir)
    ->addFromTags('v2.0.*')
    ->add('2.0', '2.0 branch')
    ->add('master', 'master branch')
;

return new Sami($iterator, array(
    'theme'                => 'symfony',
    'versions'             => $versions,
    'title'                => 'Symfony2 API',
    'build_dir'            => __DIR__.'/../build/sf2/%version%',
    'cache_dir'            => __DIR__.'/../cache/sf2/%version%',
    'remote_repository'    => new GitHubRemoteRepository('symfony/symfony', dirname($dir)),
    'default_opened_level' => 2,
));
```

To generate documentation for a PHP 5.2 project, simply set the
`simulate_namespaces` option to `true`.

You can find more configuration examples under the `examples/` directory
of the source code.

Sami only documents the public API (public properties and methods);
override the default configured `filter` to change this behavior:

``` php
<?php

use Sami\Parser\Filter\TrueFilter;

$sami = new Sami(...);
// document all methods and properties
$sami['filter'] = function () {
	return new TrueFilter();
};
```

# Rendering

Now that we have a configuration file, let's generate the API
documentation:

``` bash
$ php sami.phar update /path/to/config.php
```

The generated documentation can be found under the configured `build/`
directory (note that the client side search engine does not work on
Chrome due to JavaScript execution restriction, unless Chrome is started
with the "--allow-file-access-from-files" option -- it works fine in
Firefox).

By default, Sami is configured to run in "incremental" mode. It means
that when running the `update` command, Sami only re-generates the files
that needs to be updated based on what has changed in your code since
the last execution.

Sami also detects problems in your phpdoc and can tell you what you need
to fix if you add the `-v` option:

``` bash
$ php sami.phar update /path/to/config.php -v
```

  
  
# Search Index

The autocomplete and search functionality of Sami is provided through a
search index that is generated based on the classes, namespaces,
interfaces, and traits of a project. You can customize the search index
by overriding the `search_index_extra` block of `sami.js.twig`.

The `search_index_extra` allows you to extend the default theme and add
more entries to the index. For example, some projects implement magic
methods that are dynamically generated at runtime. You might wish to
document these methods while generating API documentation and add them
to the search index.

Each entry in the search index is a JavaScript object that contains the
following keys:

  - type  
    The type associated with the entry. Built-in types are "Class",
    "Namespace", "Interface", "Trait". You can add additional types
    specific to an application, and the type information will appear
    next to the search result.

  - name  
    The name of the entry. This is the element in the index that is
    searchable (e.g., class name, namespace name, etc).

  - fromName  
    The parent of the element (if any). This can be used to provide
    context for the entry. For example, the fromName of a class would be
    the namespace of the class.

  - fromLink  
    The link to the parent of the entry (if any). This is used to link a
    child to a parent. For example, this would be a link from a class to
    the class namespace.

  - doc  
    A short text description of the entry.

One such example of when overriding the index is useful could be
documenting dynamically generated API operations of a web service
client. Here's a simple example that adds dynamically generated API
operations for a web service client to the search index:

``` jinja
{% extends "default/sami.js.twig" %}

{% block search_index_extra %}
    {% for operation in operations -%}
        {"type": "Operation", "link": "{{ operation.path }}", "name": "{{ operation.name }}", "doc": "{{ operation.doc }}"},
    {%- endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

This example assumes that the template has a variable `operations`
available which contains an array of operations.

Always include a trailing comma for each entry you add to the index.
Sami will take care of ensuring that trailing commas are handled
properly.
